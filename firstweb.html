    <p>NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've never been.</br> 
     Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience.</br>
     By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>

      <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Show</h2>
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=womens+tops&sprefix=women+%2Cprime-instant-video%2C335&crid=13X21QSVFO37G" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg" alt="nice website!"/></a>
      <p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't </br>
      so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows</br>
      are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're</br>
      worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, </br>
      and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
      <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

      <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the </br>
      whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what </br>
      the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear </br>
      shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your</br> 
      feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
